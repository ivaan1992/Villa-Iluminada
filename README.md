# My First Capstone

This is my first professional capstone I created for Microverse.

This project consists in making my own web page.

For this project I thought about an event that ocurrs each December, in my state.

I worked pretty harder.  


This is the <a href=https://www.behance.net/gallery/29845175/CC-Global-Summit-2015>template</a> that I should use for making this project. Original design idea by Cindy Shin in Behance.

<b><h3>MOBILE VERSION</h3></b> 📱

To my capstone mobile version from this template I followed these steps: 

1-. Made the header which includes the hamburguer icon menu and added some medias. 

2-. Made the headline section which includes a description of the event, and added a picture.  

3-. Made the program section which includes the some cards that show us everything there is in the event. 

4. Finally made the speakers section which includes random people, but some of them are envolved in the event, but added a JavaScript function in the botton. 

5-. After that, I made the about web page.  

<b>This is the Mobile Version</b>

<b><h3>DESKTOP VERSION</h3></b> 💻 🖥️
To create Desktop Version I followed these steps: 

1-. Opened another CSS file.

2-. Copied and edited the original code.

3-. Added media queries.

4-. Added images, edited some texts, edited the form, and take off the last line.
